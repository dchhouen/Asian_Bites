    On 1st floor, there are a cafe, a gift shop and photo corners, which is open to everyone (There are outdoor seating area in front of the building too)
    On 2nd floor, there are sanrio-themed seating area and photo corners. However, in order to access the 2nd floor, you need to book tickets in advance via Naver (the link is in their IG bio. The downside is that you need to have Korean Phone number with Korean Carrier to book the tickets üòü The tickets are free tho)
    Don‚Äôt miss out if you are a sanrio lover like I am!"  ,
